# GameOff_2024
My entry for the GameOff 2024 game jam, using the Fanshawe GDP1 (https://www.fanshawec.ca/programs/gdp1-game-development-advanced-programming/current) program source code as a starting point.

Starting point was the GFLW "triangle of death" demo September 2024 (https://www.glfw.org/docs/latest/quick.html) and built to what you see at the start of this repository (The github link for the in-class code is here: https://github.com/FeeneyCodes/GDP202425).

You can watch my boring lectures about the code here (if you're having trouble sleeping or need some background noise, etc.): https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLfONzXg3-TjhRcSwhS9vIG3M9CuvR2X3b and I stream the lectures on twitch: https://www.twitch.tv/feeneycodes
